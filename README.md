## Bio
I'm Evelyn. I'm not a full time software engineer, but I started working on side projects in early 2024, and I love learning new things. 
My main interests are in social media that's designed to bring you closer with people you already know instead of focusing on discoverability or huge audiences.

## Projects:

Current:
  - temporary group chats mobile app
  - easy self-hosting 
  - self-hosted blog for my friends

Past:
  - 2048 clone
  - tiny scale social media
